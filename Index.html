        <p>You may have noticed that this is an almost duplicate page of README.md.
            I'm attempting to code in HTML so I can get the bonus points, so I'm literally just copying what I did in
            Markdown,
            but in HTML and if I can't get it the exact same formatting, I'm not even gonna
            worry about it dude. I'm just glad I can code this much in HTML.</p>
